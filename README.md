# GD32F470 Balance Car and Develope by Makefile

**as the old rule , try this game for practicing**

##  something new

- Traditional way to calculate the PID value is manually adjust the parameters. I think its to inconvenient to do. So this time , I want to use the Deep Learning to figure out the PID value.

- I have a jetson nano. How to use the board is difficulty for me . Something like Deepstream ,Tensorrt and CUDA confuse me . I need to learn that by this project.

  Good luck for me . I will keep updating
